    "# Mathematical Representation of PSO in Football Context\n",
    "\n",
    "PASTA, grounded in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)$^1$, adapts this algorithm, typically inspired by the coordinated behavior of natural swarms like birds and fish(this is what makes our approach biomimetic), for football strategies. PSO excels at optimizing complex problems through iterative solution improvements, making it well-suited for simulating social behaviors of animals. In a football context, each player, akin to a member of a swarm, adjusts their position and strategy relative to others, guided by simple yet effective rules. The collective aim in this case is to minimize the distance to the ball carrier in as little time as possible, mirroring the natural swarms' foraging or hunting strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "PSO‚Äôs mathematical framework involves updating each 'particle's' (player's) velocity and position, considering both their **personal best moves** and the team's **collective best strategies**. The key equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Velocity Update Equation:**\n",
    "   $$ V_{ij}(t+1) = w V_{ij}(t) + c_1 r_1 (P_{ij}(t) - X_{ij}(t)) + c_2 r_2 (P_{gj}(t) - X_{ij}(t))$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "This equation reflects how a player (particle) adjusts their movement speed (velocity) based on their current momentum (inertia), personal past successful maneuvers (cognitive component), and the team's overall best past maneuvers (social component). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Position Update Equation:**\n",
    "   $$ X_{ij}(t+1) = X_{ij}(t) + V_{ij}(t+1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation determines the player's new position on the field, based on their updated velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ X_{ij}(t) $ represents the position of player $ i $ in aspect $ j $ (e.g., X or Y axis on the field) at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ V_{ij}(t) $ denotes the velocity of player $ i $ in aspect $ j $ at time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ w $ is the inertia weight, balancing exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (refining current strategies).\n",
    "- $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $ are acceleration constants that regulate the importance of personal vs. collective experience.\n",
    "- $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ are random factors introducing variability and unpredictability in movements.\n",
    "- $ P_{ij}(t) $ is the personal best position achieved by player $ i $ in aspect $ j $ until time $ t $.\n",
