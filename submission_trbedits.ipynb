    "Our submission proposes a new metric named PASTA, derived from Particle Swarm Optimization, to evaluate and quantify defensive secondaries effectiveness at swarming ball carriers. \n",
    "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method for finding optimal paths, leveraging a social component where multiple agents (analogous to a flock of birds or a school of fish, or in this case, a defensive unit) share information to collectively navigate towards the best solutions in complex spaces. This characteristic makes it highly suitable for addressing multi-agent problems where coordination and cooperation are essential. In a football context, each player adjusts their position and strategy relative to others, guided by simple yet effective rules. The collective aim (objective function) in our case is to minimize the distance to the ball carrier."

The operation $||P_i - T||$ denotes the Euclidean Distance between the particle's position $P_i$ and the target $T$, which we aim to minimize.\n",

From there, we find the best swarm point weighted on the $\\theta$ defenders will have to take to reach $T$ and the distance to $T$, $d$, for each defender.\n",

    "### 3. Particle Swarm Optimization \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the objective function and target are defined, we can run PSO. For any given play, we initialize a swarm of particles, each denoted as $ P_i $ for the i-th particle, representing a defensive player's position on the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the play progresses following a ball carrier receiving the football, each particle updates its velocity and position based on a combination of its own best-known position $ \\vec{p}_{best,i} $, the best-known positions $ \\vec{p}_{best,neigh} $ of its neighboring particles, and the best-known position $ \\vec{g}_{best} $ of the entire swarm. These updates are mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\vec{v}_i^{(new)} = \\vec{v}_i + \\phi_1 \\cdot rand_1 \\cdot (\\vec{p}_{best,i} - \\vec{x}_i) + \\phi_2 \\cdot rand_2 \\cdot (\\vec{g}_{best} - \\vec{x}_i) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\vec{x}_i^{(new)} = \\vec{x}_i + \\vec{v}_i^{(new)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\phi_1 $ and $ \\phi_2 $ are coefficients that determine the weighting of the stochastic acceleration terms, and $ rand_1 $, $ rand_2 $ are random numbers in the range [0,1]. This dynamic process allows the swarm to collectively evolve, aiming to minimize the distance to the target, the ball carrier, in accordance with the objective function $ ||P_i - T|| $, effectively mimicking the coordinated movement of a football team's defense during a play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the updates to the velocities and positions of the particles are made the next crucial step is to evaluate the objective function for each particle. This is done by assessing how close each particle's current position $ \\vec{x}_i $ is to the target $ T $, using the objective function $ ||P_i - T|| $.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating the objective function, each particle's personal best position $ \\vec{p}_{best,i} $ is updated if the current position yields a better (lower) value of the objective function than previously recorded. Similarly, the best-known position of the swarm $ \\vec{g}_{best} $ is updated if any particle discovers a position that is closer to the target than any previously known positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle of updating velocities and positions, followed by evaluating the objective function and updating the personal and global bests, continues iteratively, until a stopping threshold is reached. The swarm collectively moves towards the target, optimizing their positions in a coordinated manner that mimics a real-life defensive unit in football, where each player adjusts their movement in response to the ball carrier, their teammates, and the overall defensive strategy.\n",

Let $ \\mathcal{P} $ and $ \\mathcal{Q} $ represent the actual path of a defender and a PSO-suggested path, respectively. The Fr√©chet distance between $ \\mathcal{P} $ and $ \\mathcal{Q} $ is defined as the minimum \"leash length\" required to connect a point moving along $ \\mathcal{P} $ and another point moving along $ \\mathcal{Q} $, such that both points traverse their respective paths from start to finish.\n",
