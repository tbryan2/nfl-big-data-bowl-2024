### Random Notes Here

Train "12th man" RL agent to become a perfect tackler. Metric is deviance from this path.

GHOST IN THE MACHINE; concept of "ghosts" like in mario kart and other video games

Model from different positions - i.e. agent from defensive lineman initial starting position
    remove impossible scenarios based on distribution of distance covered and speed for example

WHO HAD THE HARDEST CIRCUMSTANCES (IE WHICH STARTING POSITION DOES THE AGENT HAVE THE TOUGHEST TIME WITH)

TODO : 

Define "a tackle" using empirical data - how does the agent know when it's completed its task? Part of the reward function.
gracefully quit the pygame window, also make the pygame window able to go on top of or under other windows like a regular window
#1 priority is defining a reward function after the enviornment is set up 

is the agent actually starting in the right place?

NEXT ON THE TO DO LIST:

break it into smaller subclasses if that's a thing?


PUT PLAYER POSITIONS IN RESET AND OBSERVATION FUNCTIONS, RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST AS ANYTHING EXCEPT ANIMATIONS
