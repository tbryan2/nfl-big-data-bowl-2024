# NFL Big Data Bowl: "POISON: Charting the Future of NFL Defense with Swarm Intelligence"

## Introduction(tldr needed)
In NFL defense, the strategic placement and movement of secondary units - cornerbacks and safeties - are pivotal in the pursuit of tackling the ball careier in the open field. Leveraging advanced analytics, we introduce POISON (Path Optimization Index for Swarming Obstacle Navigation). Founded on particle swarm optimization principals [citation needed], POISON aims to revolutionize defensive strategy by modeling movements after intelligent swarm behaviors observed in nature.

## Particle Swarm Optimization: The Foundation of POISON
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), inspired by natural swarms like birds and fish, optimizes complex problems through iterative solution improvement. This algorithm is particularly suited to simulate the social behaviors of animals, where each member of the swarm adjusts its position relative to others based on simple rules with the common goal of foraging for food or attacking prey.

**Mathematical Representation of PSO:**

PSO's formula updates each particle's velocity and position, factoring in personal and collective experiences. The equation for PSO is:

1. Velocity Update Equation:
   $$ V_{ij}(t+1) = w V_{ij}(t) + c_1 r_1  (P_{ij}(t) - X_{ij}(t)) + c_2 r_2 (P_{gj}(t) - X_{ij}(t)) $$

2. Position Update Equation:
   $$ X_{ij}(t+1) = X_{ij}(t) + V_{ij}(t+1) $$

Where:
- $ X_{ij}(t) $ is the position of particle $ i $ along dimension $ j $ at time $ t $,
- $ V_{ij}(t) $ is the velocity of particle $ i $ along dimension $ j $ at time $ t $,
- $ w $ is the inertia weight,
- $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $ are acceleration constants,
- $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ are random values between 0 and 1,
- $ P_{ij}(t) $ is the personal best position of particle $ i $ along dimension $ j $ up to time $ t $,
- $ P_{gj}(t) $ is the global best position of any particle along dimension $ j $ up to time $ t $.

## Adapting PSO to Football
In football, we adapt the algorithm to analyze defensive secondary units consisting of two safeties and two cornerbacks. PSO determines efficient routes to decrease the distance to the ball carrier to 0 **using the same simple positioning and velocity rules** a flock of geese use to efficiently decrease the distance to the nearest food source. 
- **Tracking Data:** 
- **Utilizing player tracking data** for frame by frame x and y coordinates and velocities. can be more detailed in data description maybe i think a table with a description of the data or a diagram is best here? 

### Parameters in Adaptation Process (maybe better represented as an equation and caption? diagram? )
The adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to football involves the adjustment of several key parameters to suit the dynamics of the game. Below are the parameters used in our adaptation, along with explanations:

- **Play:** The algorithm optimizes the path for a single play.

- **Objective Function:** The function that determines target selection, considers obstacle avoidance, and minimizes the distance to the ball carrier.
  
- **Defensive Abbreviation (def_abbr):** Abbreviation for the defensive team.

- **Offensive Abbreviation (off_abbr):** Abbreviation for the offensive team.

- **Ball Carrier Identification (ball_carrier_id):** Identifies the ball carrier at the moment they get a handoff or catch a pass.

- **Positional Group:** Can be adjusted for any group of players.

- **Max Iterations:** This parameter defines the maximum number of iterations or steps the algorithm takes in a single play optimization. It ensures that the algorithm converges within a reasonable time frame.

- **Threshold Stop:** The threshold stop parameter determines how close to the ball carrier the algorithm should stop optimizing. It sets the minimum acceptable distance between the defender and the ball carrier before the optimization process concludes.

- **Inertia Weight (`w`):** In PSO, the inertia weight determines the trade-off between the particle's current velocity and its historical velocity.

- **Acceleration Constants (`c1` and `c2`):** These constants control the influence of personal and global best positions on each particle's movement. Similar to the inertia weight, we also used the golden ratio for `c1` and `c2`. This choice was made to ensure that the particle's movement is influenced proportionally by both its personal best position and the global best position.
  - **We chose to use the golden ratio (`Ï†`) as the ratio for `w`, `c1`, and `c2` based on the findings from this paper [citation needed]. In short this ratio strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation of the solution space. The golden ratio is known for its ability to promote convergence while preventing premature convergence.

- **Obstacle Avoidance Parameter:** In football, players must navigate through obstacles, including opposing players and blockers. This parameter determines how effectively a defender can navigate through such obstacles. It is fine-tuned based on the player's position and the positions of potential obstacles.

- **Time Weighting:** To account for predicting future positions of players, a time weighting parameter is introduced. This parameter estimates the best intercept angle by factoring in the expected future positions of the ball carrier and other players.

**Assumptions:**
- **Target Selection:** The algorithm's objective function is tailored to decrease distance to a predetermined target.  
- **Speed of Defenders:** defenders can adapt their speed to the max speed of the ball carrier.

## POISON Calculation
- **Optimal Path:** Calculated for each player based on the game environment, focusing on secondary units.
- **Frechet Distance:** Measures deviation from the optimal path.
- **POISON Score:** Quantifies efficiency in following the optimal swarm path.

## Analysis and Validation
- **Play Analysis:** [Placeholder for analysis of specific plays or sets of plays, including visualizations and animations]
- **Comparative Metrics:** POISON will be compared with metrics like last years big data bowl winner STRAIN [citation needed],or some other individual player metric to validate its effectiveness in a visualztion or table. 

## Discussion and Applications
POISON offers vast applications for the NFL as whole, individual teams, the media, and fans.

**Coaching Applications:**
- **Teachable Moments:** Identifying plays with significant deviations from optimal paths.
- **Reinforcement of Successful Strategies:** Highlighting plays where the secondary closely followed the optimal path.
- **Defensive Strategy and Team Development** Informing strategy and training drills based on POISON's principles.

**Broadcasting and Rankings:**
- **On-field Graphics:** Demonstrating defensive prowess through "AI Path" or SWARM optimal visualizations.
- **Player and Defense Rankings:** Showcasing how talented players and teams align with optimal paths.

## Future Considerations
- **Generalizing to Other Groups:** It would be interesting to analyze different position units, entire teams, or relevant combinations of players. 
- **Covering Potential Receivers:** Exploring POISON's application to broader defensive scenarios, such as secondaries converging on a reciever in anticipation of an incoming pass.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Refining parameters to tailor to specific team strategies and in house analytics using straties like GridSearch.
- **Incorporating Other Models:** Considering integration with models like STRAIN for enhanced analysis and perhaps better path optimization.(We could actually do this if we have time, Nick wan has a notebook we can use in our objective function or hyper parameter tuning)

## Limitations and Ongoing Development
While POISON is promising, it has areas for growth:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Again, Current parameters are based on intuitive assumptions, which could be further optimized as discussed earlier. We are limited in terms of computation resources.  
- **Max Speed Limitation:** A constraint that may not fully mirror real-life scenarios but is still effective. Given more data and time, we could fine tune this to constrain more specifically to individual player profiles but we also suspect this would do little to improve this as a tool. 
- **Target Selection:** Focusing on refining how targets are selected and pursued by the defense. Ideally, we would like to incorporate ideas from this paper [citation neede] that utilizes particle swarm optimization on moving targets. or we would like to incorporate velocity in a more realistic manner(??? not explaining this well) . both are complex problems to solve, but are worth pursuing.  

## Conclusion
POISON, inspired by nature's efficiency and adapted for football, stands to transform NFL defensive tactics. Its ability to evaluate both individual players and units, especially in covering vast areas, makes it a versatile and powerful tool in strategic defense planning. This metric not only provides tactical insights for coaches but also offers engaging analytical content for fans and broadcasters.
