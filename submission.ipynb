    "# A Biomimetic Approach to the NFL Big Data Bowl: Charting the Future of NFL Defense with Swarm Intelligence and PASTA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "> #49ers defense has a \"Swarm Player Of The Day\" award for , as DC DeMeco Ryans says, \"whoever attacking the ball, got turnovers or made special effort on certain plays.\"\n",
    "> LB Fred Warner was leader in clubhouse through camp. \"Fred had a lot, Bosa had a lot, Kerry Hyder, they top 3\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -- [Cam Inman --> Original Tweet from 2022](https://x.com/CamInman/status/1564349536499220480?s=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guiding Question:** Do defenses that limit yards after catch (YAC) embody the principles of swarming to the ball when making a tackle? \n",
    "\n",
    "**DeMeco Ryans**, recognized as the 2022 Assistant Coach of the Year for his role as the 49ers Defensive Coordinator, has championed the concept of swarming to the ball. This philosophy, which [continues to resonate](https://www.houstontexans.com/video/head-coach-demeco-ryans-we-talked-about-a-swarm-mentality-and-that-s-what-we-did) with Ryans in his current position as head coach of the Houston Texans, emphasizes the importance of players converging on a ball carrier with intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "in the tweet (X?), DeMeco Ryans reveals his principals for what it means to **SWARM**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attacking the Ball\n",
    "- Turnovers\n",
    "- Special Effort\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging advanced analytics, we introduce a new metric called **PASTA (Path Analysis via Swarm-Tracked Accuracy)** that aims to quantify a defense's ability to collectively swarm to a common target in an efficient way. We will use DeMeco Ryans aspects of SWARM to guide us on this journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are confident our underlying methodology offers broad applicability. The flexibility of our framework allows for tailoring to the diverse needs of coaches, players, fans, and media. This adaptability forms one of the strengths of our approach, enabling stakeholders to modify the guiding questions to suit their unique perspectives and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particle Swarm Optimization\n",
    "PASTA is founded on particle swarm optimization principals [citation needed], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), inspired by natural swarms like birds and fish, optimizes complex problems through iterative solution improvement. This algorithm is particularly suited to simulate the social behaviors of animals, where each member of the swarm adjusts its position relative to others based on simple rules with the common goal of foraging for food or attacking prey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Representation of PSO:**\n",
    "\n",
    "PSO's formula updates each particle's velocity and position, factoring in personal and collective experiences. The equation for PSO is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Velocity Update Equation:\n",
    "   $$ V_{ij}(t+1) = w V_{ij}(t) + c_1 r_1  (P_{ij}(t) - X_{ij}(t)) + c_2 r_2 (P_{gj}(t) - X_{ij}(t)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Position Update Equation:\n",
    "   $$ X_{ij}(t+1) = X_{ij}(t) + V_{ij}(t+1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ X_{ij}(t) $ is the position of particle $ i $ along dimension $ j $ at time $ t $,\n",
    "- $ V_{ij}(t) $ is the velocity of particle $ i $ along dimension $ j $ at time $ t $,\n",
    "- $ w $ is the inertia weight,\n",
    "- $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $ are acceleration constants,\n",
    "- $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ are random values between 0 and 1,\n",
    "- $ P_{ij}(t) $ is the personal best position of particle $ i $ along dimension $ j $ up to time $ t $,\n",
    "- $ P_{gj}(t) $ is the global best position of any particle along dimension $ j $ up to time $ t $.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Attacking the Ball: Adapting PSO to Football\n",
    "We adapt the typical PSO Algoritm to the dataset by adding the following elements:\n",
    "- **Target Selection:**: Our algorithm first selects the best collective common target for the particles in the swarm to optimize toward. \n",
    "- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Our algorithm considers other players on the field as obstacles so not to draw optimal paths through other players on the way to the target. \n",
    "- **Time-Weighting:** Our algorithm considerst the future positions of obstacles and the ball carrier when calcualting the optimal path. It does this in the same way an actual defesnive player may predict the future positions of the other players on the field by anticipating where their future position may be. \n",
    "\n",
    "We initially dubbed our implementation as \"Adapted Particle Swarm Optimization with Time Weighting and Obstacle Avoidance, or APSOTWOA\"—quite a mouthful. PASTA is better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters in Adaptation Process\n",
    "To illustrate the flexibility of our adpated PSO approach, please see the key parameters used in our implementtion: (could move to appendix if low on word count, tims diagram may explain this as well) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Play:** The algorithm optimizes the path for a single play\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective Function:** The function that determines target selection, considers obstacle avoidance, and minimizes the distance to the ball carrier.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Ball Carrier Identification (ball_carrier_id):** Identifies the ball carrier at the moment they get a handoff or catch a pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positional Group:** Can be adjusted for any group of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max Iterations:** This parameter defines the maximum number of iterations or steps the algorithm takes in a single play optimization. It ensures that the algorithm converges within a reasonable time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Threshold Stop:** The threshold stop parameter determines how close to the ball carrier the algorithm should stop optimizing. It sets the minimum acceptable distance between the defender and the ball carrier before the optimization process concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inertia Weight (`w`):** In PSO, the inertia weight determines the trade-off between the particle's current velocity and its historical velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acceleration Constants (`c1` and `c2`):** These constants control the influence of personal and global best positions on each particle's movement. Similar to the inertia weight, we also used the golden ratio for `c1` and `c2`. This choice was made to ensure that the particle's movement is influenced proportionally by both its personal best position and the global best position.\n",
    "  - **We chose to use the golden ratio (`φ`) as the ratio for `w`, `c1`, and `c2` based on the findings from this paper [citation needed]. In short this ratio strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation of the solution space. The golden ratio is known for its ability to promote convergence while preventing premature convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Obstacle Avoidance Parameter:** In football, players must navigate through obstacles, including opposing players and blockers. This parameter determines how effectively a defender can navigate through such obstacles. It is fine-tuned based on the player's position and the positions of potential obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Weighting:** To account for predicting future positions of players, a time weighting parameter is introduced. This parameter estimates the best intercept angle by factoring in the expected future positions of the ball carrier and other players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- **Target Selection:** The algorithm's objective function is tailored to decrease distance to a predetermined target.  \n",
    "- **Speed of Defenders:** defenders can adapt their speed to the max speed of the ball carrier.\n",
    "more asssumptons? \n",
    "\n",
    "## PASTA Calculation\n",
    "- **Optimal Path:** Calculated for each player based on the game environment\n",
    "- **Frechet Distance:** Measures deviation from the optimal path.\n",
    "- **PASTA Index:** Quantifies efficiency in following the optimal swarm path.\n",
    "diagram or further explanation needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis and Validation\n",
    "- **Play Analysis:** [Placeholder for analysis of specific plays or sets of plays, including visualizations and animations]\n",
    "- **Comparative Metrics:** POISON will be compared with metrics like last years big data bowl winner STRAIN [citation needed],or some other individual player metric to validate its effectiveness in a visualztion or table. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion and Applications\n",
    "POISON offers vast applications for the NFL as whole, individual teams, the media, and fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coaching Applications:**\n",
    "- **Teachable Moments:** Identifying plays with significant deviations from optimal paths.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement of Successful Strategies:** Highlighting plays where the secondary closely followed the optimal path.\n",
    "- **Defensive Strategy and Team Development** Informing strategy and training drills based on PASTA's principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broadcasting and Rankings:**\n",
    "- **On-field Graphics:** Demonstrating defensive prowess through \"AI Path\" or PASTA optimal visualizations.\n",
    "- **Player and Defense Rankings:** Showcasing how talented players and teams align with optimal paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Considerations\n",
    "- **Generalizing to Other Groups:** It would be interesting to analyze different position units, entire teams, or relevant combinations of players. \n",
    "- **Covering Potential Receivers:** Exploring PASTA's application to broader defensive scenarios, such as secondaries converging on a reciever in anticipation of an incoming pass.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Refining parameters to tailor to specific team strategies and in house analytics using straties like GridSearch.\n",
    "- **Incorporating Other Models:** Considering integration with models like STRAIN for enhanced analysis and perhaps better path optimization.(We could actually do this if we have time, Nick wan has a notebook we can use in our objective function or hyper parameter tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Ongoing Development\n",
    "While PASTA is promising, it has areas for growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Again, Current parameters are based on intuitive assumptions, which could be further optimized as discussed earlier. We are limited in terms of computation resources.  \n",
    "- **Max Speed Limitation:** A constraint that may not fully mirror real-life scenarios but is still effective. Given more data and time, we could fine tune this to constrain more specifically to individual player profiles but we also suspect this would do little to improve this as a tool. \n",
    "- **Target Selection:** Focusing on refining how targets are selected and pursued by the defense. Ideally, we would like to incorporate ideas from this paper [citation neede] that utilizes particle swarm optimization on moving targets. or we would like to incorporate velocity in a more realistic manner(??? not explaining this well) . both are complex problems to solve, but are worth pursuing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "PASTA, drawing inspiration from natural efficiency and tailored for football, is poised to revolutionize NFL defensive strategies. Its capacity to assess individual players and units, particularly in expansive coverage, positions it as a versatile and potent tool in strategic defense planning. This metric provides not just tactical insights for coaches but also engaging analytical content for fans and broadcasters."
